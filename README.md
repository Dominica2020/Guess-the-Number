# Project 12 for 100 Days of Code Bootcamp
- Coded a guess the number game using python
- Imported some ASCII art for title
- User can choose difficulty type, either "easy" (10 tries) or "hard" (tries)
- If user has not ran out of counts the game will let them know if their guess is too high or too low
- The game will let the user know if they guessed correctly (won) or lost
